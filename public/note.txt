In this project we are trying to use the MVC model and implementing OOP in php

 *** MVC model which stands for model view controller****

  It is a method to organise larger scales application by sepearting different parts into MVC 

 SO the model is the part that communicates with the DB ie it does all the required calculations at the

  level of the db an send the response to the view which is the UI ie what the client or user sees.

 the controller is the part that instruct the model and on what they are suppose to perform, this 

 controller for example is like the URL which when you click on students URL to searches for the students 

 model and performs the required actions and dispplays the result on the students view etc.

 ***** Here we will create classes which will stand for our different pages
